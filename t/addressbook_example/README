This test is based on protobuf 3.5.0 examples.

I think protobuf-c should support this kind of test, which ties with protobuf example.
When you build this source, there will be two executable binaries. 

First one is add_person, which receives personal information. I modified from protobuf 3.5.0 c++ example, just a little. 
second one is list_people, which shows the list of personal information, using simple code. 

To compile it, you should modify the Makefile to let your compiler know where the protobuf-c library is installed. 
Please notice that I just wanted you to consider adding this kind of test. I don't mind you to reject it, but, somebody may make this kind of test well, somedays.

When you execute 'add_person' binary, it will require input information. It works with exactly same way with protobuf example. 
When you execute 'list_people' binary, (I just hard coded the file name, so you should modify the list file name first.) it shows unstable results. 

There must be a wrong code, but I don't know how to fix it.
